# Movies Haskell

This is the Haskell implementation of the [movies exercise](https://github.com/julianespinel/movies).

`movies-haskell` was created with educational purposes, to be used as a resource for this meetup: [CÃ¡lculo Lambda con Javascript & Haskell Fuera de la Academia](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-fMACkbLu/events/255235149/)

## Installation

1. Install Haskell and Stack: https://haskell-lang.org/get-started
1. Install Yesod: `stack install yesod-bin --install-ghc`
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:julianespinel/movies-haskell.git`

## Development

Start a development server with:

```
stack exec -- yesod devel
```

As your code changes, your site will be automatically recompiled and redeployed to localhost.

## Testing

```
stack test --flag movies:library-only --flag movies:dev
```

(Because `yesod devel` passes the `library-only` and `dev` flags, matching those flags means you don't need to recompile between tests and development, and it disables optimization to speed up your test compile times).

## Usage

With the movies microservice you are able to execute the following actions:

1. Check if microservice is alive
1. Create a movie
1. Find a specific movie
1. Find a set of movies
1. Update a movie
1. Delete a movie
